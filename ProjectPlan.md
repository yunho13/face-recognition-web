# Project Plan: Face Recognition Web Dashboard

This project aims to build a face recognition system integrating machine learning models with a web-based dashboard.

## Milestones & Tasks

### Milestone 1: Project Setup & Research
- [ ] Initialize project structure (Done)
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository (Done)
- [ ] Research suitable Hugging Face models for face detection & recognition
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment and install dependencies

### Milestone 2: Core ML Implementation
- [ ] Implement camera feed capture using OpenCV
- [ ] Integrate Hugging Face model for face detection
- [ ] Implement face recognition logic
- [ ] Test ML model performance with sample data

### Milestone 3: Web Dashboard Development
- [ ] Design simple dashboard layout
- [ ] Implement backend API (Flask/FastAPI) to serve video feed
- [ ] Create frontend to display real-time video and recognition results
- [ ] Add controls to start/stop recognition

### Milestone 4: Deployment & Documentation
